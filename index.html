<p> It has been 30 days we started living under the Movement Control Order (MCO). Many things have changed likes life in the city does not busy like usual, school and educational institutions are still closed but they learn through online and we have more time with families. </p> 

<p> It is a drastic change, but we have to be open and accept the situation by adopting a positive attitude. So, in this session I will share about my experience as a student in handling this Movement Control Order. Activities that I do is to help me to deal with boredom or stress staying at home. By staying at home, we can find creative ways to create a few experiences! Scrolling on to find out my activites.

<p> One of my experience is, I used the free time during MCO to spend time with my family. Since before we family were busy and some stay away from home, we were less time together. So, we plan to use this quality time effectively to spend time together. An activity we were do together such as having a family meal, watching tv together, make time to talk and listen to each other and do many activities together. For upcoming Ramadan, hopefully we can do many religious activities together. It was an great experience because we can create more memories together and develop strong bonds, love and relationship among family members. </p>

<p> I took MCO as a opportunity to spend time on cooking activity. Cooking can be made into an enjoyable experience with gain a new knowledge about cooking art. For example, I tried to cook a variety of dishes for my family. The idea of cooking various dishes and recipes I took from Youtube, Google and media social because the feed was filled with home cook dishes. Actually, I enjoyed to spend time in kitchen. </p>

<p> For me as a student, I am enjoyed learning through online because it made my life become more easier. Nowadays, online learning are a great solution to the student to stay connected with lectures during MCO. ODL give me new experience because it teach me how to use virtual platform to study. For example, teachings method include using Google Classroom, Zoom, and share videos through Youtube. To make sure the learning is not disrupted, all my lectures always keeps in touch through phone. All the assignment and task will be update through online. </p>
